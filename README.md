# Road to GAN - Generative Adversarial Networks
 
Generative Adversarial Network. GAN is a new type of Deep Learning Architecture, introduced in 2014, and rapidly became popular due to ability of create new synthetic content that looks like the real one. Change the age and hair style of a person's photo or highly improve the resolution of texture in games are just some uses of GAN that applications like FaceApp and NVidia Super Resolution use. This series of Meetups will introduce the science and math behind this network, starting with this first part, Deep Learning Fundamentals, showing what Is an Artificial Neural Network, how it works and how to training it using some demonstrations. In the second meetup of the series, the Convolutional Neural Network will be introduced and finally, in the third meetup, the Generative Adversarial Network will take the stage.

## Part 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals

What Is an Artificial Neural Network, how it works, and how to train it using some demonstrations.


## Part 2: Convolutional Neural Networks

This second part will introduce the revolutionary Convolutional Neural Networks, showing, with applications and demos, how it works and why it is responsible for the new R&D boom in Neural Networks.
